Once upon a time, there was a brave knight who could and would do only two 
things in his entire life: fighting against evil dragons and traveling 
around the world. One day he traveled to a small kingdom, of which the king 
looked worried all day. The king invited the knight to his palace and told 
him the reason why he was unhappy: months ago a dragon occupied his secret 
treasury located in a mountain, and now he owned tons of gold but could not 
get even close to them. The king asked the knight to drive the dragon out of 
his treasury and promised a quarter of his treasure as payback. The knight 
accepted this job. Early in the morning of the following day, the knight 
headed off to the mountain.

He goes to the mountain with his fellow soldiers and destroys the dragon. He comes back to the king and announces, "I have defeated the dragon! Grant me the treasure please!" 
The king says, "You are a knight of this kingdom but I do not grant you the treasure."
The knight says, "This is outrageous, it's unfair! I'm more powerful than any of you!"
So he leaves the kingdom and keeps on traveling around the world.
